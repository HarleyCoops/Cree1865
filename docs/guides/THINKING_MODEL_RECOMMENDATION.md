# Should You Use a Qwen Thinking Model?

## What Are Thinking Models?

**Thinking models** (like Qwen3-Thinking):
- Use **chain-of-thought reasoning**
- Break down problems into intermediate steps
- Generate reasoning traces before answers
- Better for **complex multi-step problems**

**Standard models** (like Qwen3-30B-A3B):
- **Direct instruction-following**
- Concise, focused responses
- Faster inference
- Better for **straightforward tasks**

## For Dakota Grammar Tasks

### Task Types in Your Dataset:

1. **Pattern Identification**: "Identify the grammatical pattern: [verb] šni"
   - **Answer**: Simple pattern recognition
   - **Thinking needed?**  No - straightforward

2. **Translation**: "Translate this Dakota sentence: ..."
   - **Answer**: Direct translation
   - **Thinking needed?**  No - pattern matching

3. **Affix Application**: "Apply this rule: ..."
   - **Answer**: Morphological transformation
   - **Thinking needed?**  No - rule application

4. **Morphology**: "What affix creates X?"
   - **Answer**: Direct morphological knowledge
   - **Thinking needed?**  No - memory recall

### Your System Prompt:
```
"Translate or explain each prompt concisely..."
```

**Key word: "concisely"** - You want direct answers, not long reasoning chains!

## Recommendation: **NO, Use Standard Model**

### Why Standard Qwen3-30B-A3B is Better:

 **Faster inference**
- Direct answers = shorter responses
- Less token generation = faster training
- More efficient on 8 A100s

 **Better for RL training**
- RL rewards direct, correct answers
- Thinking traces add noise to reward signal
- Model learns to be concise and accurate

 **Matches task requirements**
- Tasks want concise answers
- Not complex reasoning problems
- Pattern recognition and recall

 **More cost-effective**
- Fewer tokens generated
- Faster training iterations
- Lower compute costs

### When Thinking Models WOULD Help:

If your tasks were:
-  Complex multi-step reasoning
-  Need to show work
-  Problem-solving with intermediate steps
-  Mathematical/logical proofs

But your tasks are:
-  Pattern recognition
-  Direct translation
-  Rule application
-  Morphological transformations

**These don't need thinking!**

## Available Models

### Standard (Recommended):
- **Qwen3-30B-A3B**  (what we recommended)
- **Qwen3-72B-A3B** (larger alternative)
- **Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct** (smaller, faster)

### Thinking (Not Recommended):
- Qwen3-Thinking variants (if available)
- Add unnecessary overhead
- Slower inference
- Don't match your task type

## Exception: If You Want to Experiment

If you want to test thinking models:
1. **Run small eval** (50 examples) on thinking model
2. **Compare** to standard model
3. **Check if thinking helps** (probably won't for these tasks)

But for training, stick with **standard Qwen3-30B-A3B**.

## Final Answer

**Use Qwen3-30B-A3B (standard, NOT thinking)**

**Why:**
-  Tasks are straightforward (not complex reasoning)
-  Faster training and inference
-  Better for RL (direct reward signal)
-  Matches "concise" requirement
-  More cost-effective

**Don't use thinking model** - it adds overhead without benefit for Dakota grammar tasks!
